/* This authorization_endpoint should be requested by the end user device and not in the backend
 of your application, since the requesting device is used to determine authorization 
 for the particular device. You could, for example,
 handle this by presenting the user with a link or a button to click to initiate the redirect flow.
 You must provide a redirectUri, where the authorization code will be delivered.
 See the express example provided below.

 You can add a state value of your choosing to test for CSRF attacks. Your application then should check, 
 that the state value given to the authorization endpoint matches the one returned to the redirect uri.
 If the state values do not match, there has likely been a CSRF attack. In this case your application
 should return a 401 Unauthorized error code. */
